## Overview

This repository is a customized adaptation of the **NVIDIA RAG Blueprint v2.1.0**.

While the original blueprint is designed for high-memory infrastructure (A100 80GB GPUs), **this version has been optimized to run fully functional on 3x NVIDIA A100 40GB GPUs**.

It serves as a reference solution for a foundational Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, demonstrating how to set up a solution that uses NVIDIA NIM and GPU-accelerated components within more constrained hardware environments. To achieve this, specific models have been swapped for efficient, high-performance alternatives (such as the Nemotron Nano 4B), and the vector database has been offloaded to CPU to maximize GPU memory availability for inference and ingestion.

## Key Features

This customized blueprint includes the following active features and services:

- **Optimized resource usage:** configured to run on 40GB VRAM GPUs by using lightweight yet powerful NIMs.
- **Full observability stack:** pre-configured and enabled by default, including:
  - **OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector** for trace collection.
  - **Zipkin** for distributed tracing visualization.
  - **Prometheus** for metrics collection.
  - **Grafana** for monitoring dashboards.
- **Hybrid search:** enabled by default (dense + sparse search) for improved retrieval accuracy.
- **Multimodal ingestion:** Support for extracting text, tables, charts, and infographics from PDFs, PPTX, and DOCX.
- **CPU-offloaded vector database:** Milvus is configured to run on CPU to reserve GPU VRAM for LLM and embedding tasks.
- **Sample user interface:** includes the `rag-playground` for immediate interaction.
- **OpenAI-compatible APIs**: easy integration with existing tools.

## Target Audience

This blueprint is for:

- **Developers** who want a quick start to set up a RAG solution with NVIDIA NIM but have access to hardware with lower VRAM capacity (specifically A100 40GB cards) compared to the standard requirements.

## Software Components

The following are the components included in this customized blueprint, reflecting the active services:

* **NVIDIA NIM Microservices**
    * **Response generation (inference)**
      * [NIM of nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-4B-v1.1](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemotron-nano-4b-v1_1) (replaces the 49B model for efficiency).
    * **Retriever models**
      * [NIM of nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) (optimized with 1024 dimensions).
      * [NIM of nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2)
      * [NeMo Retriever Page Elements NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-page-elements-v2)
      * [NeMo Retriever Table Structure NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-table-structure-v1)
      * [NeMo Retriever Graphic Elements NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemoretriever-graphic-elements-v1)
      * [PaddleOCR NIM](https://build.nvidia.com/baidu/paddleocr)

* **RAG Orchestrator server** - Langchain based.
* **Milvus Vector Database** - running in **CPU-only mode** (v2.5.3) to conserve GPU memory.
* **Observability Services**:
    * Zipkin
    * Prometheus
    * Grafana
    * OpenTelemetry Collector
* **Ingestion** - [Nvidia-Ingest](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nv-ingest/tree/main) for parsing PDFs, Word, and PowerPoint documents.

## Technical Diagram

The architecture remains logically consistent with the original blueprint. The workflow proceeds as follows:

1. **User interaction**: users interact via the **RAG Playground** or APIs.
2. **Query processing**: the **RAG Server** processes the query.
3. **Retrieval**: the **Retriever** queries the **Milvus Vector Database** (running on CPU in this deployment) using embeddings generated by the **E5-v5 Embedding NIM**.
4. **Reranking**: top results are refined by the **Reranking NIM**.
5. **Response Generation**: the context is sent to the **Llama 3.1 Nemotron Nano 4B NIM** to generate the answer.
6. **Observability**: metrics and traces are collected in the background by OTel, Zipkin, and Prometheus.

## Minimum System Requirements

### OS Requirements
Ubuntu 22.04 OS

### Driver versions
- GPU Driver - 530.30.02 or later
- CUDA version - 12.6 or later

### Hardware Requirements
This specific deployment is tuned for:
- **GPUs**: 3x NVIDIA A100 (40GB VRAM)
- **Deployment tool**: Docker & Docker Compose (v2.29.1 or later)

> **Note:** Unlike the original blueprint which requires A100 80GB cards, this version runs comfortably on 40GB cards due to the model swaps (Nano 4B & E5-v5) and CPU offloading of Milvus.
